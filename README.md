# Vue Router TS Quickstart
> Starter template for a Vue 3 project using Vue Router and TypeScript


## Start a new Vue project

This project was generated using the GUI invoked by this command:

```sh
$ npx @vue/cli ui
```

Options chosen were Yarn, Vue 3, TypeScript and Vue Router, as they make sense for my projects.

Plus Jest, ESLint and Prettier.

But without Babel, as that it only useful for less than 5% of browsers and it adds dependencies.


## Project setup

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```sh
$ yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```sh
$ yarn build
```

### Run your unit tests

```sh
$ yarn test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files

```sh
$ yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
