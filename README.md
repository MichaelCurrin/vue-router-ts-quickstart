## Start a new Vue project

This project was generated using the GUI invoked by this command:

```sh
$ npx @vue/cli ui
```

Options chosen were Yarn, Vue 3, TypeScript and Vue Router, as they make sense for my projects. Plus Jest, ESLint and Prettier, but without Babel because that it only useful for less than 5% of browsers and it adds dependencies.
